This is a simple Windows application developed using .NET, this application specifically expects the dlls path as input and provides with the list of dlls and their versions.

Quite a useful application, it can be used at the enterprise level to check with dlls versions. Hope you find it useful.
Feel free to clone the repo and use it as per your requirements. :))
